## FAQ ##

### What is this? ###

ScalaPrimavera is a project to bring the [Scala Language](http://scala-lang.org) power to the [Spring Framework](http://springsource.org)
world.

Some companies have a heavy investment on the Spring Framework and related projects, but also want to try Scala.
ScalaPrimavera let's they try Scala in a safer way, while learn functional programming concepts that could improve code quality.

### Who is behind this? ###

[Cobalto Labs SAS](http://cobaltolabs.com) is a company based in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia, with a broad experience in Spring development, we deliver SpringSource certified training and consulting across the Americas.

We develop succesful projects using Spring and Scala, and we know that huge impact that this combination could bring to a project.

ScalaPrimavera was developed as our internal library, now we are sharing this with the development community with an open source license (Apache 2.0)

### Are you planning to make money with this? ###

Of course, we're a company that are in the business of making money with software.

In the future we'll sell professional services based on ScalaPrimavera but in a way that don't f*** the users.

### Do you have a roadmap? ###

Not a detailed one, but we have broad plan in mind:

From the version 0.1.* to the 0.9.* ScalaPrimavera will don't have a stable API. We'll could change the API, in a way that will don't be backwards compatible.
This versions are designed to early adopters and application prototypes (Altough we already use this on production on our projects).

In the version 1.0.* we plan to have a stable API, that could be used in production

The versions 1.\*.\* we like to add some famous Scala libraries to the Spring world

### Why this silly name? ###

*Primavera* is the spanish word for "Spring", in a serie of fortunate events this also a valid word in Italian, Catalan, Portuguese and other languages.
We're very proud of our hispanic heritage, so we want to reflect this in the name of our project
